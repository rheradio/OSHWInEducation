## Introduction

The open-source hardware movement is becoming increasingly popular due to the emergence of successful low-cost technologies, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and thanks to the community of _makers_ that actively share their creations to be freely studied, modified, and re-distributed. Numerous authors have proposed distinct ways to seize this approach for accomplishing a variety of learning goals: to help students to be more fluent and expressive with new technologies, to enable scholars to explore scientific concepts, to promote students' creativity, etc. This paper reports a systematic mapping study that overviews the literature on open-source hardware in education. The results of our work provide: (i) guidance on the published material (identifying the most relevant papers, authors, publication sources, institutions, and countries);  (ii) information about the pedagogical uses of open-source hardware (showing the educational stages and subjects where it is principally applied); and (iii) directions for future research.
